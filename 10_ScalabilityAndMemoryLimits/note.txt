1. Dividing Up Lots of Data
    * By Order of Appearance
        - advantage: never using more machines than are necessary
        - disadvantage: lookup table might be large and complex

    * By Hash Value
        the data is stored on machine #[mod(hash(key), N)] with N machines
        - advantage: no need for a lookup table
        - disadvantage: when one of the machine is full, we need to split or
        shift data into other machines (which is very expensive)

    * By Actual Value
        utilize the characteristic of your data to store "similar" data on the
        same machine so that looking up requires fewer machine hops

    * Arbitrarily
        - advantage: the simpliest way to do load balancing
        - disadvantage: large lookup table

2. Optimization
    When our data are divided into several machine, we can do some optimization
    * Batch operation:
        - batch the operation on a single machine and do it all at once
